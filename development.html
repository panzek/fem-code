                                    environment must earn the respect of group members. Working in the tech industry is
                                    no
                                    exception. How do you accomplish this?

                                    You know your stuff, you deliver and you work for the team — not for yourself. When
                                    you
                                    show up to a meeting, you are prepared to speak about the subject and ask helpful
                                    questions. Your goal is to figure out how you can deliver value to your team and
                                    your
                                    organization. Then deliver, even if it's something you currently do not know how to
                                    do.
                                    You'll earn praise by learning and using a skill your team members might not have.
                                    You'll earn respect by sharing that skill with others. As author and computer
